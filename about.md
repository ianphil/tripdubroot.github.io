Ian Philpot is an adept software developer and technologist. He’s worked on [Emmy award winning projects](http://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2015/05/05/xxii-olympic-winter-games-propels-nbc-sports-group-to-11-sports-emmy-awards/) and with customers around the globe. Cloud technologies are his focus and passion. When he’s not behind a computer you’ll find him on a trail, hanging on to his bike or out of breath trying to run.
