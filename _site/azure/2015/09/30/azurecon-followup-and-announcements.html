<p>Yesterday was <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/azurecon/">AzureCon 2015</a>, and it was chalk full of goodness. I sat for all four of the Keynotes and live tweeted (or whatever it's called). I had a great time, but it was ball busting work. A side affect of doing that was, I feel really informed. I also got a few new followers and lot's of retweets... Awesome and thanks!</p>
<p>The keynotes are posted in their full 1080 glory. All of the sessions are on demand, so spend 30 minutes and watch one. Hey spend the whole day and watch more than one... Here are a few that caught my eye, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ianp.co/1hajbDB">Live event streaming and employee video portals: how video is changing the way we work and collaborate - 21:05</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ianp.co/1hajqyB">New Azure Security Center helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats - 21:48</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ianp.co/1hajBtH">Windows Server containers, Docker, and an introduction to Azure Container Service -34:35</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ianp.co/1hajNJf">Introducing Azure DevTest Lab - 19:41</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, don't forget the <a href="http://ianp.co/1hak3rN">AzureCon Challenge</a>. Free. Labs. Prizes. Awesome.</p>

</ol>
</li>
<li>Azure CDN
<ol>
<li>A strategic partnership with Akamai which will enable integration of Akamai’s industry-leading CDN capabilities into Azure.

Public sector customers will have convenient access as both platforms have achieved the FedRAMP JAB’s highest certification.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Azure Mobile Engagment

</li>
<li>Azure SQL Data Warehouse
<ol>
<li>Azure SQL Data Warehouse, including recently released Power BI integration, is now broadly available for public preview. Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a new, first-of-its-kind elastic data warehouse in the cloud. It’s the first enterprise-class cloud data warehouse that can dynamically grow, shrink and pause compute in seconds independent of storage, enabling you to pay for the query performance you need, when you need it.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>ExpressRoute
<ol>
<li>The general availability of ExpressRoute for O365 and Skype for Business, as well as the ability to connect to Microsoft Azure’s Government Cloud via ExpressRoute. With ExpressRoute for Office 365, customers can access Office 365</li>
<li>New pricing plans for ExpressRoute. Effective Oct 1st 2015, customers will have two different data plans for their ExpressRoute connections. Relative to the prior model where pricing plans were tied to the service provider, these plans provide more flexibility in choosing the right plan based on your data usage. For more details, refer here.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>New VM Families and Pricing
<ol>
<li>The general availability of DV2, our next generation of D-series Virtual Machine instances. DV2 instances can be used as Virtual Machines or Cloud Services. DV2 instances are based on a customized 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon® E5 v3 (Haswell) processors, and with Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 can go to 3.2 GHz, making DV2 up to 35% faster than the current D-series instances. Dv2-series and D-series are ideal for enterprise-grade applications that demand faster CPUs, better local disk performance, or higher memories.</li>
<li>Price reductions on A8-A11 Instances. As part of our commitment to save you costs whenever we can, we’re reducing prices of A8, A9, A10 and A11 instances by as much as 60%. These instances carry the powerful Intel Xeon E5 processors and are suitable for compute intensive workloads like high-performance clusters, modeling and simulations, video encoding, and other compute or network intensive scenarios. The new prices will be effective October 1st, 2015. Please visit the Virtual machines pricing page for pricing details.</li>

Azure Resource health will be available for public preview in October.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Finacial Services Compliance Program
<ol>
<li>Announcement of the Financial Services Compliance Program. We know the financial industry has more regulatory oversight than most other industries. To make it easier for our customers to adopt Azure, we’re excited to offer a new compliance program aligned to global financial regulatory oversight and risk management requirements. As part of the program, customers will get access to audit report evidence as well as platform penetration test results.</li>
