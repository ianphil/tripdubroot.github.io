<p>So you're in the new portal and trying to deploy something? It runs for a while and then fails! The message returned isn't great and looks something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>The operation name is: Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/extensions/write The status is: Failed</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it happens... A good way to start to troubleshoot that is using PowerShell. <a href="http://ianp.co/1PSAclL" target="_blank">Go setup PowerShell</a> if you haven't already. Then use the command:</p>
<pre>Get-AzureResourceGroupLog -Name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt;</pre>
<p>This will return all the log entries from the last deployment. It should provide you a window into what is actually happening. Last I used this was deploying an Azure SQL database. The error I received was lacking detail, but after I ran that command I was able to see that East US was running hot and I need to provision in a different Datacenter...</p>
<p>There are other variations of that command as well. If you want a specific deployment that you've run for a resource group you would use this command:</p>
<pre>Get-AzureResourceGroupLog -Name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; -DeploymentName &lt;DeploymentName&gt;</pre>
<p>If you want all the logs for a resource group you would run:</p>
<pre>Get-AzureResourceGroupLog -Name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; -All</pre>
<p>Hope this helps you figure out what's happening with a Resource Manager based deployment goes wrong!</p>

        <p>I'm a huge fan of Sublime Text (and a paying customer), so when I heard we'd released a light weight code editor called <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>, I had to go see...</p>
<p>I was happy to see that it is trully light weight, shares some of the Sublime Text layout features, and is cross platform. Awesome... After downloading and installing it, I have to say I was a little lost. This is because I was thinking Visual Studio and not Sublime Text. Once I made that leap and realized there is no file -&gt; New Project I went to work. Here is what I did...</p>
<p>First I noticed on the "Start" screen there is an instruction that states "If you don't have an existing project, we suggest using <a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank">Yeoman </a>to scaffold out a new one.".</p>
<p>[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="878"]<a href="https://adminian.blob.core.windows.net/blog/VSCode-Yeoman.PNG"><img class="" src="/assets/VSCode-Yeoman.PNG" alt="vscode" width="878" height="663" /></a> VSCode... use Yeoman[/caption]</p>
<p>Ok, so let's do that. I already had node installed so I just walked through verifying I had the latest and greatest node/npm bits using:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh prettyprint" data-lang="sh"><span class="pln">node </span><span class="pun">--</span><span class="pln">version </span><span class="o"><span class="pun">&amp;&amp;</span></span><span class="pln"> npm </span><span class="pun">--</span><span class="pln">version</span></code></pre>
<p>This shows that I am in fact running better than:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node.js v0.10.x+</li>
<li>npm v2.1.0+</li>
</ul>
<p>From there let's get the Yeoman tool-set installed globally.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh prettyprint" data-lang="sh"><span class="pln">npm install </span><span class="pun">--</span><span class="pln">global yo bower grunt</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln">cli</span></code></pre>
<p>Once I've installed the tool set, I wanted a generator to scaffold out the project so I don't have too.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh prettyprint" data-lang="sh"><span class="pln">npm install </span><span class="pun">--</span><span class="pln">global generator</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln">angular@0</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="lit">11.1</span></code></pre>
<p>Now! I have all the necessary tools to actually lay down some starter bits and get coding. Since I'm using the Yeoman tutorial as the basis to get my project going and I like Angular we'll scaffold out an Angular starter project.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh prettyprint"><span class="pln">yo angular</span></code></pre>
<p>I'm not ready to use Sass right now so I will say no to that and accept the defaults from there.</p>

<p>Awesome! Now I have an Angular Web project ready to go. Let's open it in VSCode and start work. File -&gt; Open Folder aaaannnd...</p>

<p>Next post we'll do some work in VSCode... till then.</p>

        <p>Sometimes maths is awesome. I've been catching up on the podcast <a href="http://www.infinitemonkeycage.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Infinite Monkey Cage</em></a>. In one of the episodes they talk about number theory and specifically narcissistic numbers. My interest was peeked, so I had to write some quick code to prove out this theorem?? myself.</p>
<p><strong>nar·cis·sism</strong> /ˈnärsəˌsizəm/ (noun) - excessive or erotic interest in oneself and one's physical appearance.</p>
<p>A narcissistic number, as defined by Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_number" target="_blank">here</a>, as a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. So basically:</p>
<p>153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153</p>
<p>How can this not intrigue you?</p>
<p>[code lang="powershell"]<br />
function isNarcissisticNumber {<br />
    param([int]$number)</p>
<p>    # Convert numbers to an array to work with each number and get a count of intergers<br />
    $numbers = $number.ToString().ToCharArray()</p>
<p>    # A place to total up each individual integer<br />
    $nar = 0</p>
<p>    # This is where the magic happens. We get the power equal to the length of the array<br />
    # for each of the individual intagers then get the sum of all.<br />
    foreach($num in $numbers) {<br />
        $num = [char]::GetNumericValue($num)<br />
        $nar += [math]::Pow($num, $numbers.Length)<br />
    }</p>
<p>    # Simple check to see if the total of the individual numbers is the same as the<br />
    # inital number.<br />
    if ($nar -eq $number) {<br />
        return $true<br />
    }<br />
    else {<br />
        return $false<br />
    }<br />
}</p>
<p>1..10000 | foreach { if ( isNarcissisticNumber $_ ) { $_ } }<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>The output will look like this:</p>

<p>TL;DR: Build a site to do wireless surveys: <a href="https://wlansurvey.azurewebsites.net/">https://wlansurvey.azurewebsites.net/</a></p>
<p>So this post has a misleading title... Because I'm not going to explain how this works, Azure Websites continuous deployment is not anything really new, and also It's well documented <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MovingAWebsiteToAzureWhileAddingContinuousDeploymentFromGit.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the family and I recently moved into a new house. Our ISP was out today, running cables and getting things setup. Since I didn't really know how well my wireless router was going to cover the house, I asked Nick the fella working on getting me back online, if he had the ability to do a wireless survey of my house.</p>
<p>Nick said, "Well they give us this <em>Airport Utillity</em> app on our phone. I can tell you what the db levels are, but I'm not really sure what they mean".</p>
<p>Problem: This person should be able to tell me what my signal quality is, room by room.</p>
<p>Solution: Five minutes googling with bing lead me to a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15797920/how-to-convert-wifi-signal-strength-from-quality-percent-to-rssi-dbm" target="_blank">Stack Overflow post</a> that sounded smart enough and even had math explaining how to go from dBm to Quality percentage. <strong>Time to deploy something to Azure.</strong></p>
<p>Enter Azure Websites Continuous Deployment. While he finished up the house, I started writing some quick code, pushed to GitHub, and setup my website in Azure to deploy from... you guessed it GitHub.</p>
<p>At this point you maybe asking: "Pray tell, how did you deploy to Azure with no internet connectivity?".</p>
<p>To that I say: "With my Verizon Jetpack, of course".</p>
<p>By the time he was finished, I'd installed the <em>Airport Utility</em> app on my iPhone. Ran around the house gathering the dBm metrics for each room, and plugged them into: <a href="http://wlansurvey.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank">http://wlansurvey.azurewebsites.net</a>.</p>
<p>He was a little shocked, but took down the web address and said he was going to tell all the guys at the office.</p>
<p>Awesome! Hope you all had a great weekend... I spent mine moving.</p>
