<p><strong>Social Tools</strong></p>
<p>Blogging isn't necessarily part of the job, but it doesn't hurt. I host my blog over at <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>. I like the service... I've tried most of the others and keep coming back to WP... Lately I've been using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8621" target="_blank">Windows Live Writer</a> to post updates. I've tried using Word and the WP clients. I like WLW right now, so I use it.</p>
<p>Managing feeds and links I find interesting has been somewhat of a struggle for me. Right now I'm using <a title="Readly" href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/readly/97407b59-3e08-41e3-a2b3-add7cc19ef3a" target="_blank">Readly</a> as my feed reader on Windows 8. On Windows Phone 8 I've been using <a title="Nextgen Reader" href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/nextgen-reader/643381de-4724-e011-854c-00237de2db9e" target="_blank">Nextgen Reader</a>. I use <a title="Pocket" href="http://getpocket.com" target="_blank">Pocket</a> to save any links I'd like to spend more time with. The problem is that there isn't a Windows 8 app or Phone 8 app. I setup an email trigger at <a title="IFTT" href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTT</a> so that anything I email to my IFTT address will be added to Pocket. I was a fan of <a title="Instapaper" href="http://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">Instapaper</a>, but for now I'm using Pocket. I use <a title="Delicious" href="https://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a> to archive the links that I favorite in Pocket...</p>
