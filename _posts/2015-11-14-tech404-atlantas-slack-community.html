<p>Community is important to me.</p>
<p>Community is important to Microsoft and to many other people and businesses. If it's important to you and you're in the Atlanta area you should checkout <a href="http://tech404.io">Tech404</a>.&nbsp; This is the sign up link. It'll take you to a page where you put in your email. You'll then receive a confirmation in your inbox. That email contains a link to the Slack sign up page where you'll enter user info like email and password. </p>
<p>A word about slack: awesomeness. A few more: Slack is a communication tool for teams of people. There are a lot extensions called <a href="https://slack.com/integrations">integrations</a>, many of which are developer focused. There is also <a href="https://slack.com/downloads">clients</a> for all platforms that you can download or install from the various stores. Lastly, there is an extensive <a href="https://api.slack.com">API</a> to bend the service to your will...</p>
<p>So if you're in the ATL, you work with tech like JavaScript or Azure or Docker, and you want to work with some of the best Atlanta has to offer... Signup and join the conversation. </p>
