<p>Microsoft loves Linux.</p>
<p>Who is this Microsoft? and what did you do to telnet?.. Gopher must've ate it. Open Source for life!</p>

<p>Those fellows who work on PowerShell must be crazy! Who'd want port 22 open on a Windows box?</p>
<p>Me.</p>
<p>No more nc.exe bro dawg! Captn_Jack and his fellow RedHat wearing brethren can finally manage Windows and Linux over thy administrator controlled port.</p>

<p>Supercilious really...</p>
<p>But why is SSH coming? I mean it's only 30 years in the making...</p>
<p>Well <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2015/06/03/looking-forward-microsoft-support-for-secure-shell-ssh.aspx">here </a>is what the PowerShell Team has to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finally, I'd like to share some background on today’s announcement, because this is the 3rd time the PowerShell team has attempted to support SSH.  The first attempts were during PowerShell V1 and V2 and were rejected.  <strong>Given our changes in leadership and culture, we decided to give it another try and this time, because we are able to show the clear and compelling customer value, the company is very supportive.</strong>  So I want to take a minute and thank all of you in the community who have been clearly and articulately making the case for why and how we should support SSH!</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis put on the key point.</p>
