<p>I haven't posted in a while. Shame shame shame... Today I am writing to you about YouTube's live streaming service. I was checking out the <a href="https://live.asp.net/">Asp.Net weekly stand-up</a> and noticed, it's what they use. I went off to investigate and realized it's really simple to setup.</p>
<p>Navigate off to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard">https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard</a> and agree to the terms. You'll notice then that there is a "Stream Now" link. Click that...</p>
<p>Off on the right conveniently located near the video player is a checklist. This checklist walks you through setting up an encoder and hooking it up to YouTube.</p>
<p>I went with Wirecast, because I have a copy. I'd recommend downloading <a href="http://www.telestream.net/wirecastplay/landing.htm">Wirecast Play</a> free. It's a pretty awesome tool and will authenticate with your YouTube account. Then click stream...</p>
<p>As a person with close ties and invested interest in <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/media-services/">Azure Media Services</a>, we need something this easy, this free, and this without the need for an <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=510935&amp;culture=en-US&amp;country=US">Office365 subscription</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll setup a reoccurring live stream for us folks in the ATL... hmmm.</p>
