<p>So you're in the new portal and trying to deploy something? It runs for a while and then fails! The message returned isn't great and looks something like:</p>
<blockquote><p>The operation name is: Microsoft.ClassicCompute/virtualMachines/extensions/write The status is: Failed</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it happens... A good way to start to troubleshoot that is using PowerShell. <a href="http://ianp.co/1PSAclL" target="_blank">Go setup PowerShell</a> if you haven't already. Then use the command:</p>
<pre>Get-AzureResourceGroupLog -Name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt;</pre>
<p>This will return all the log entries from the last deployment. It should provide you a window into what is actually happening. Last I used this was deploying an Azure SQL database. The error I received was lacking detail, but after I ran that command I was able to see that East US was running hot and I need to provision in a different Datacenter...</p>
<p>There are other variations of that command as well. If you want a specific deployment that you've run for a resource group you would use this command:</p>
<pre>Get-AzureResourceGroupLog -Name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; -DeploymentName &lt;DeploymentName&gt;</pre>
<p>If you want all the logs for a resource group you would run:</p>
<pre>Get-AzureResourceGroupLog -Name &lt;ResourceGroupName&gt; -All</pre>
<p>Hope this helps you figure out what's happening with a Resource Manager based deployment goes wrong!</p>
