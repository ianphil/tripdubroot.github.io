<p>TL;DR: Build a site to do wireless surveys: <a href="https://wlansurvey.azurewebsites.net/">https://wlansurvey.azurewebsites.net/</a></p>
<p>So this post has a misleading title... Because I'm not going to explain how this works, Azure Websites continuous deployment is not anything really new, and also It's well documented <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MovingAWebsiteToAzureWhileAddingContinuousDeploymentFromGit.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the family and I recently moved into a new house. Our ISP was out today, running cables and getting things setup. Since I didn't really know how well my wireless router was going to cover the house, I asked Nick the fella working on getting me back online, if he had the ability to do a wireless survey of my house.</p>
<p>Nick said, "Well they give us this <em>Airport Utillity</em> app on our phone. I can tell you what the db levels are, but I'm not really sure what they mean".</p>
<p>Problem: This person should be able to tell me what my signal quality is, room by room.</p>
<p>Solution: Five minutes googling with bing lead me to a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15797920/how-to-convert-wifi-signal-strength-from-quality-percent-to-rssi-dbm" target="_blank">Stack Overflow post</a> that sounded smart enough and even had math explaining how to go from dBm to Quality percentage. <strong>Time to deploy something to Azure.</strong></p>
<p>Enter Azure Websites Continuous Deployment. While he finished up the house, I started writing some quick code, pushed to GitHub, and setup my website in Azure to deploy from... you guessed it GitHub.</p>
<p>At this point you maybe asking: "Pray tell, how did you deploy to Azure with no internet connectivity?".</p>
<p>To that I say: "With my Verizon Jetpack, of course".</p>
<p>By the time he was finished, I'd installed the <em>Airport Utility</em> app on my iPhone. Ran around the house gathering the dBm metrics for each room, and plugged them into: <a href="http://wlansurvey.azurewebsites.net" target="_blank">http://wlansurvey.azurewebsites.net</a>.</p>
<p>He was a little shocked, but took down the web address and said he was going to tell all the guys at the office.</p>
<p>Awesome! Hope you all had a great weekend... I spent mine moving.</p>
