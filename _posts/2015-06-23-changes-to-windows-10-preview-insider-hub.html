<p>I use this tool to say up-to-date with what's going on in Windows 10. The most recent announcement stated that this is not going to be installed going forward. It also lists how to get it back, so for posterity sake I'd like to post it here to remember. From the announcement...</p>
<article id="content" class="content"><strong>Insider Hub &amp; Windows Feedback app</strong></p>
<p>Because we’re getting ready for the final release, we’re removing a few things we don’t expect to ship to everyone. So starting with the next build, the Insider Hub will no longer be pre-installed. Windows Insiders can reinstall the Insider Hub app through the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Settings, System, Apps &amp; features</li>
<li>Click Manage optional features then Add a feature</li>
<li>Select the Insider Hub entry (the list is in alphabetical order) and click Install.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will have to go through this process with each build we flight prior to the final release on July 29th, but once we start flighting new builds after July 29th it will be preinstalled again.<br />
The Windows Feedback app will continue to be included in builds and in the final release. But as I noted above, the Windows Feedback app will have functionality specific to Windows Insiders who are registered for the program with their MSA connected to their PC.</p>
