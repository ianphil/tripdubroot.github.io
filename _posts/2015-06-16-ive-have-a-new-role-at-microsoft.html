<p>So, I was a Primer Field Engineer, but now I'm a Technology Evangelist. What's up with this move? Yes I have a very technical skillset in development and cloud technologies. I've worked on some of the largest projects and with some of the toughest customers. I've been very fortunate to get to do awesome work over the past five years as a PFE. Now it's time to share my learnings and pay it forward… at least for a while.</p>
<p>I have a simple plan, be genuine. It's worked really well for me working with customers in a more intimate atmosphere, but I suspect it will serve me well as I continue my journey in this new role. In this new role, I'll be working with the community in Atlanta, hanging out at places like the Atlanta Tech Village working with startups, and creating content for Channel 9. I'm only a couple weeks into the role, but so far it's kind of exciting.</p>
<p>I have been thinking of how to best share and I think some practical and impractical projects will be best, so I'm working on two projects as of now:</p>
<p><strong>Kinect Driver for Azure</strong> – This will be used to off load processing of the Kinect data streams to Azure… Think IoT.</p>
<p><strong>Azure DevOps Toolkit</strong> – This will demonstrate various roadmaps that one can use to deploy and monitor apps in Azure… Think 10 deploys a day.</p>
<p>I'm still prototyping these out, but expect to see some content relating to these in the coming months. So yea, let's get started!</p>
